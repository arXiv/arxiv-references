        <p>We investigate the existence and stability of timelike and null circular orbits (COs) in the equatorial plane of general static and axisymmetric (SAS) spacetime. We first obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-existence of timelike COs. It is then proven that there will always exist timelike COs at large ρ in an asymptotically flat SAS spacetime with a positive ADM mass and moreover, these timelike COs are stable. Some other sufficient conditions on the stability of timelike COs are also solved. We then found the necessary and sufficient condition on the existence of null COs. It is generally shown that existence of timelike COs in SAS spacetime does not imply the existence of null COs, and vice-versa, regardless whether the spacetime is asymptotically flat or the ADM mass is positive or not. These results are then used to show the existence of timelike COs and their stability in an SAS Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton spacetimes whose metric is not completely known. We also used the theorems to deduce the existence of timelike and null COs in some known SAS spacetimes.</p>

      <title>I. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Axisymmetric spacetimes are of special interests in
observational astrophysics and theoretical study of
space1 time and gravitational theories. This symmetry is
cruv cial to some important observable phenomena such as
9 torus or jet-like features [1], fast rotating objects,
super8 nova ejecta [2] and binary systems that generates
gravita6 tional waves. On the other hand, many theoretical work
01 such as Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) [3], EYM-Higgs [4],
. EYM-Dilaton [5–7] solutions, f(R) gravity [8], traversable
4 wormholes [9], cosmic strings [10] and domain walls [11],
0 and metric affine gravity [12] can be carried out in this
17 symmetry due to its simplicity and yet non-triviality. In
: particular, the recent direct observation of gravitational
iv waves [13, 14] are believed to originate from binary
system whose spacetime in the far region during the merging
rX and spacetime in the entire space after complete merging,
a are indeed axisymmetric.</p>
      <p>In the spacetimes possessing axisymmetry, it is often
desirable to know the existence and stability of circular
orbits (COs) in the equatorial plane. These orbits for
example can be used to characterize the properties of
the central object [15] or in numerical modeling of stellar
systems [16]. They are also of huge importance to the
study of flow of matter in the accretion disk around
rotating black holes (BHs) or binary systems [17–19]. For
these reasons, these COs, including the ones that are
more special such as marginal stability COs (MSCOs),
have been studied by many authors over the years for
various axisymmetric spacetimes, including both static
and stationary ones (see Ref. [15] and papers therein).</p>
      <p>In this paper, we study the existence and stabilities
of COs for general static and axisymmetric (SAS)
spacetimes. This work is a natural extension of the authors’
recent results on the existence and stability of COs in
general spherically symmetric spacetimes [20].
Previously, there have been work on the solution of COs and
their stabilities in particular SAS spacetimes. Letelier
[21] studied the stability of BH + disk/ring/multipolar
systems using the Rayleigh criteria. González and
LópezSuspes considered the stability of COs in Weyl (vacuum)
spacetimes [22]. Dolan and Shipley studied the stable
photon orbits in a few spacetimes [23]. In addition,
Beheshti and Gasperín studied the MSCO in particular
stationary and static axisymmetric spacetimes [24]. We
emphasis that unlike works by these authors, in this work
the metric function of the SAS spacetimes are kept
general, i.e., the results that we obtained are not restricted
to a particular forms of metric functions. Rather, our
methodology deals with general SAS spacetimes and our
results are even applicable to metrics whose explicit
expression is not yet known.</p>
      <p>We organize the paper in a few sections. In section II
we setup the SAS metric, and derive the geodesic
equations in the equatorial plane and the CO conditions in
terms of the metric functions and first integral constants.
In section III we analyze the existence of non-trivial
timelike COs and give the results in the form of a theorem.
We then show in section IV that asymptotically flat SAS
spacetimes with a positive ADM mass will always allow
timelike COs. The stabilities of these timelike COs are
studied and some sufficient conditions for the COs to be
stable (or unstable) are obtained. The existence and
stability issue for null CO are studied in section VI. It is
found that there can exist metrics allowing timelike CO
while no null COs, and metrics that allowing null CO but
no timelike COs. Finally, in section VII we first show
that the results in this work match those in Ref. [20].
And then a very powerful application of our results, to
assert the existence and stability of COs for SAS EYMD
spacetime whose metric functions’ exact expression are
not known, is illustrated. We also use our results to
study the existence of COs in a few other known SAS
spacetimes and discuss possible extensions of the current
work.</p>
      <p>In this section, we setup the metric and derive the
geodesic equations and conditions for the COs in the
equatorial plane of a stationary and axisymmetric
spacetime, although what we need in later sections are only
these quantities in a static and axisymmetric spacetime.
Our notations in this section follow that of Ref. [24].</p>
      <p>
        For stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, the most
general form of the metric can be given in local
coordinates by the Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou line element [24]
ds2 = e2U (dt−ωdφ)2 −e−2U [e2γ(dρ2 +dz2)+ρ2dφ2] (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        )
where (t, ρ, z, φ) are the coordinates and U, ω and γ are
the metric functions depending on ρ and z only.
Equivalently, and for easier reference to the metric functions,
we can rewrite it as
ds2 = A(ρ, z)dt2 − B(ρ, z)dtdρ
      </p>
      <p>−C(ρ, z)dφ2 − D(ρ, z)(dρ2 + dz2)
where we have set A(ρ, z) = e2U , B(ρ, z) = 2ωe2U ,
C(ρ, z) = ρ2e−2U − ω2e2U and D(ρ, z) = e2(γ−U). Note
there is a relation between these functions</p>
      <p>C = ρ2 − B2/4 /A.</p>
      <p>
        We further assume that the spacetime possesses a local
reflection symmetry at some fixed z value and we shift the
z coordinate so that it becomes the z = 0 plane, which
is also called the equatorial plane. This way any orbit
of a particle with zero initial off-plane momentum will
remain in the plane and the motion becomes effectively
2+1 dimensional whose metric is described after changing
from A(ρ, z) etc. to A(ρ) etc. by
ds2 = A(ρ)dt2 − B(ρ)dtdρ − C(ρ)dφ2 − D(ρ)dρ2. (

To obtain the geodesic equations, we can start from

where ˙ denotes the derivative with respect to the proper

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ).
Here ǫ = 1, 0 respectively for timelike and null geodesics.
Because t and φ are cyclic coordinates in Lagrangian, we
can obtain two first integrals

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        )
where E and L are real constants identified as the specific
energy and angular momentum of the particle at infinite
ρ. These equations can be inverted to express t˙ and φ˙ in
terms of E and L as
t˙ =
φ˙ = −

These are equivalent to the geodesic equations of t and
φ but with τ integrated once. Substituting Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ) and
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ) into Lagrangian (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ) yields the last geodesic equation,
for ρ(τ ), as

        )
Φ(ρ)
≡ 4ρ2A(ρ)D(ρ) ≡ V (ρ)
where Φ(ρ) is defined as the numerator and V (ρ) as the
entire right hand side of Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ) and plays the role of
an effective potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        To establish the condition for a CO, we can first
compute the conjugate momentum pρ of ρ as
pρ =
∂L = −D(ρ)ρ˙
∂ρ˙
Taking derivative with respect to τ , we obtain
and henceforth denotes the derivative with respect to
ρ. Mathematically, Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ) can be thought
as an autonomous system in 2-dimensional phase space
spanned by ρ and pρ. Then the fixed point (FP) of this
system, denoted by (ρ∗, pρ∗), satisfies
 ρ˙|(ρ∗,pρ∗) = − Dp(ρρ∗∗) = 0,

at some instantaneous time and all times after. Noting
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ), this is equivalent to require that at (ρ∗, pρ∗)
Φ(ρ∗) = 0

      <p>
        (

Clearly any solution of Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ) or equivalently (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        )
defines a CO of the spacetime with orbit radius given by ρ∗.
Conversely, it is also easy to show that any CO in this
spacetime will satisfy these equation systems. Therefore
COs of the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ) and FP defined by the system (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        )
or (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ) are equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this work, we then restrict ourselves to the case of
static metric, mainly due to its simplicity and the
solvability of the desired equations. This allows us to set
B(ρ) = 0 in all the equations above, including metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        )
and Eqs. (

        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ). These two systems then will be
our starting point for the analysis of the existence and
stability of COs in the spacetime described by metric
ds2 = A(ρ)dt2 − ρ2/A(ρ)dφ2 − D(ρ)dρ2.

      <title>III. EXISTENCE OF TIMELIKE COs</title>
      <p>We consider the existence of COs for timelike geodesics
in this section, while the null case will be considered in
section VI.</p>
      <p>
        First we write out Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ) explicitly in terms of the
parameters E, L and the metric function A(ρ), as
ρ2∗ −A2
ρ3A′ [ρ∗A′ − 2A]A2
∗
      </p>
      <p>E2
L2
=
ρ2A
∗
0
.</p>
      <p>
        (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        )
For a given A(ρ), if in the space spanned by energy E and
angular momentum L there exists a non-empty set S for
whose element (E, L) the solution to Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ) does
exist, then we say for that A(ρ) the COs can exist (for that
(E, L) at ρ = ρ∗). If the set S is empty then we say
that there exist no COs for the spacetime described by
that A(ρ). Apparently, if COs exist for some (E, L) then
the two equations in Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ) will both have solutions
simultaneously. If either of the equations is not satisfied
by any ρ, then the COs do not exist for that (E, L).
Therefore the form of A(ρ) is crucial in determining the
existence of COs. Before proceeding further however, a
remark is in order regarding A(ρ). Even though it is
possible for A(ρ) to be negative in some region of the
spacetime, in this paper we assume that A(ρ) is positive in
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        )
the range of ρ in which we seek the FP (or CO), because
otherwise according to the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ) the ρ coordinate
should have to be interpreted as time, not radius and a
FP in time is not of our interest. We also assume that in
the range of ρ the spacetime is not singular so that it is
always possible to do coordinate transformation to make
A(ρ) differentiable if it was not in the first place.
Therefore throughout this paper, we will assume that A(ρ) is
already made differentiable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ) is a linear system for E2 and L2. It will have
no solution to E2 and L2 if and only if the rank of the
augmented matrix is larger than that of the coefficient
matrix, which we solved to find
      </p>
      <p>A(ρ∗) − ρA′(ρ∗) = 0.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there always exist the following solution
and</p>
      <p>A − ρA′ &lt; 0
2A − ρA′ &gt; 0.</p>
      <p>A(ρ∗) [2A(ρ∗) − ρ∗A′(ρ∗)] ,
2 (A(ρ∗) − ρ∗A′(ρ∗))
ρ3A′(ρ∗)</p>
      <p>∗
2A(ρ∗) (A(ρ∗) − ρ∗A′(ρ∗))
.</p>
      <p>Given that both E and L are real, it is clear that these
two equations might not have solutions if the right hand
sides are always negative for all ρ. However, it is also
clear that if A(0) &gt; 0, there will always exist a solution
at ρ∗ = 0 for E = pA(0) and L = 0. This solution,
though technically is also a CO, is not relevant in most
physically important metrics. Usually in the center ρ =
0, either the spacetime is singular, or the presence of
matter will prevent the test particle from doing timelike
geodesic motions, or it is just a trivial CO such as in the
case of Minkovski spacetime. Therefore in the following
sections when the timelike COs are discussed, CO at this
point is excluded and we concentrate on non-trivial COs.</p>
      <p>
        We can now study Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) separately for the
(non-)existence of their solutions. Firstly for Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ),
keeping in mind that E is real and noticing (2A − ρA′) −
(A − ρA′) = A &gt; 0, this equation will not have any
solution in a region of ρ if and only if in this region
That is, in this region of ρ we can equate the left hand
sides of the inequalities to some arbitrary but positive
functions δ(ρ) and ζ(ρ):
and
      </p>
      <p>A(ρ) − A′(ρ)ρ = −δ(ρ),
2A(ρ) − A′(ρ)ρ = ζ(ρ).</p>
      <p>
        Under condition (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) alone we see that A′ &gt; 0 and
consequently Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) will not have any solution. Therefore
for the purpose of violating the entire system of (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ), condition (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) is enough and we do not have to
solve (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ). Noticing Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ), the δ(ρ) in Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) can
be relaxed to be semi-positive rather than strictly
positive. This equation can be readily solved for an arbitrary
δ(ρ). However for the sake of a shorter expression for the
solution, we further change δ(ρ) to ρ2dκ(ρ)/dρ without
losing any generality as long as κ′(ρ) ≥ 0. This way the
Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) can be solved to find the solution
      </p>
      <p>A(ρ) = ρκ(ρ)
where an integral constant has been absorbed into κ(ρ),
which is a positive and monotonically increasing but
otherwise arbitrary function.</p>
      <p>
        Secondly, for Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ), beside the case (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ), this
equation can also be violated if its numerator is negative
      </p>
      <p>
        A′(ρ) &lt; 0,
which automatically makes the denominator positive. It
is also easy to see that in all other cases Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) will
have solutions for some (E, L, ρ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining the above two cases, we see that the
equation system (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) will not permit a CO solution
in a region of ρ if and only if at least one of Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) is satisfied in this region. If no CO exists at all for
all ρ &gt; 0, then in the entire range of ρ, either one of (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        )
or (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) is satisfied, or these two are satisfied piecewisely.
Now we further show that the piecewise satisfaction
scenario is impossible and then establish one of the main
conclusions in this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that there exist no CO because Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) or
equivalently Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ), and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) are piecewisely satisfied:
Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) is satisfied in region ρ ∈ (a, b) and Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) is
satisfied in the region ρ ∈ (b, c). Then clearly A′ &gt; 0 in
(a, b) and in A′ &lt; 0 in (b, c). Because A′ is continuous,
we must have A′(ρ = b) = 0 and for any ρ in the small
neighborhood ρ ∈ (b − χ, b), A′(ρ) &gt; 0. On the other
hand for ρ = b − ε that is in this neighborhood and
infinitesimally close to b, we can compute [A − ρA′]ρ=b−ε
using its Taylor expansion
[A − ρA′]ρ=b−ε = A(b) + εbA′′(b) + O(ε2).
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
        )
Clearly we have [A− ρA′]ρ=b−ε = A(b) &gt; 0 to the leading
order, which conflicts with the assumption that Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        )
is satisfied here. For the case that Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        )
are satisfied respectively in the regions (b, c) and (a, b),
then a similar conflict can be proven. These conclude
that Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) cannot be satisfied piecewisely.
We can now state our conclusion:
(Theorem A) The equatorial timelike COs for the metric
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) do not exist if and only if either only Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) is
satisfied in the entire range of ρ, or only Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) is
satisfied in the entire range of ρ, but not because Eq.
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) are piecewisely satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>Here and after, we will refer to this as the timelike CO
non-existence theorem (TCONET).</p>
      <p>
        In the following we give two simple examples satisfying
respectively Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) in the entire range of ρ and
therefore do not permit any CO, and one more example
which combines the first two and satisfies Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) in
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        )
,
some range of ρ, Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) in some other range and then
neither of them in the rest, where CO lies. The first
example is given by κ(ρ) = ρ so that A(ρ) = ρκ(ρ) = ρ2,
the resulting Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) become
which permit no solution and therefore no COs. The
second example is given by A(ρ) = 1/ρ and the Eqs.
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) become
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
        )
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
        )
where the equation for L2 eliminates the existence of COs
too. The third example is a simple combination of the
above two:
ρ
      </p>
      <p>A(ρ) = 1 + ρ3 · ρ.</p>
      <p>
        At very small and large ρ, this resembles the first and
second examples respectively and therefore we expect that
the COs will not exist there. However, in the middle
range, as we can expect using the TCONET theorem,
the COs do exists. Substituting Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
        ) into (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ), we obtain
It is easy to verify that these two equations will have
solution when ρ ∈ (2−1/3, 21/3) for some (E, L).

      <title>ASYMPTOTICALLY FLAT SAS SPACETIMES</title>
      <p>In the end of last section, we see that there indeed exist
metrics forbidding the existence of any timelike CO.
However, these metrics are not asymptotically flat. People are
usually more interested in asymptotically flat spacetimes
due to their physical relevance. Therefore in this section
we analyze how the asymptotic flatness condition will
affect the existences of timelike COs in the SAS spacetimes.</p>
      <p>
        For metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ), asymptotic flatness requires that as ρ →
∞ [25, 26],
      </p>
      <p>
        2c
A(ρ) = a + ρβ + O(ρ−β−1),
(32)
where a &gt; 0, β ≥ 1 and c are constants. We then see that
any A(ρ) satisfying (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) will necessarily diverge at large
ρ and therefore not be asymptotically flat. While for
condition (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ), metric satisfying it can still be compatible
with the asymptotic flatness condition (32) and therefore
has no timelike COs. An example would be the function
(32) truncated to the second term and with a positive c.

      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Clearly this metric satisfies and (20) at the CO yields 5 (35)</title>

i.e. Eq. (

          ) and therefore has no timelike CO. This
example shows that enforcing the asymptotic flatness alone
will not make sure the existence of COs in SAS
spacetimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is however, one thing odd about this
example. The constant c in (32) although is mathematically
merely a constant in the asymptotic expansion of the
metric function A(ρ), it is physically identified with the
ADM mass for the asymptotically flat spacetime when
β = 1. It is known from the Positive Mass Theorem
that for spacetime satisfying dominant energy condition,
this ADM mass shall always be positive [27]. Therefore
adding the positive ADM mass condition will make sure
that the metric function A(ρ) violate Eq. (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ) and
guarantee the existence of COs in SAS spacetimes. We restate
this conclusion as:
(Theorem B) There will always exist equatorial timelike
COs at least at large ρ for an SAS spacetime described
by metric (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ) and which is also asymptotically flat with
a positive ADM mass.

      <title>MARGINALLY STABLE COs</title>
      <p>With the existence of COs proven for asymptotically
flat SAS spacetimes with positive ADM mass, and
existence condition given by Theorem A for general SAS
spacetimes, one important question following is the
stability of these COs. In this section we will assume that
the spacetime considered will allow timelike CO and
denote its radius as ρ = ρ∗. We then use the Lyapunov
exponent method [28] to address the question about what
form of A(ρ) will make the CO stable, unstable or have
a marginal stability. Here we use the wording “marginal
stability” instead of “marginally stable” [24] or “marginal
stable” [29] because such orbit, defined as dV (ρ∗)/dρ = 0,
is not necessarily stable even in the perturbative sense.
This definition only means that the stability at this point
is critical, i.e., it can change, disappear or split in to many
equilibria [30].</p>
      <p>
        For the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ), the Lyapunov exponents for the
system (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ) (or (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        )) is equivalent to the eigenvalues of
the linear perturbation matrix of the system, which we
found to be
where the effective potential V (ρ) is given in Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        )
with B = 0. Substituting V and using the relation (

where all of A, A′, A′′ and D are evaluated at ρ∗, and
we defined a function h as the numerator
      </p>
      <p>h(ρ) = ρA2A′′ + ρ2A′3 − 4ρAA′2 + 3A2A′.</p>
      <p>
        It is known that when λ± are imaginary, real but nonzero,
or zero, the CO will be respectively stable, unstable, or
have marginal stability. Since at the CO radius, the Eq.
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) must be broken and therefore ρ∗A′(ρ∗) − A(ρ∗) &lt;
0, it is clearly then the situation of λ± is completely
determined by h. I.e., the CO will (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) be stable if and
only if h(ρ∗) &gt; 0, (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) be unstable if and only if h(ρ∗) &lt; 0,
and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ) have marginal stability if and only if h(ρ∗) = 0.
Unfortunately, the sign of h(ρ∗) cannot be completely
determined without knowledge of A(ρ), due to two facts.
First, the A′′(ρ∗) term, which does not appear in any
form of the CO existence conditions, is not constrained
and cannot be eliminated from (36). Secondly, even if
A′′(ρ∗) were expressible through other quantities, h(ρ∗)
is only an algebraic equation at ρ∗. Without knowing
the value of the CO radius ρ∗ it is still impossible to
determine the sign of h(ρ∗).
      </p>
      <p>However, if we treat h(ρ) as a differential equation of
ρ and require its sign to be fixed at not only ρ∗ but all
ρ, then we are still able to get some sufficient conditions
for determining the stability of COs of relevant metrics.
These conditions are:
(a). If
ρA2A′′ + ρ2A′3 − 4ρAA′2 + 3A2A′ = 0
(37)
for all ρ, then the CO will always be an MSCO regardless
of the CO radius value ρ∗.
(b). If
ρA2A′′ + ρ2A′3 − 4ρAA′2 + 3A2A′ = σ(ρ) &gt; 0 (or &lt; 0)
(38)
where σ(ρ) is positive (or negative) but otherwise
arbitrary for all ρ, then the CO will always be an stable (or
unstable) CO, regardless of the CO radius value ρ∗.</p>
      <p>Condition (a) can be immediately solved to get two
possible A(ρ)</p>
      <p>
        A±(ρ) = ρ c1ρ ± qc21ρ2 − 2c2 ,
(39)
where for the + sign, we should have c1 &gt; 0 or c1 &lt;
0, c2 &lt; 0 and for the − sign, c1 &gt; 0, c2 &gt; 0 in order
for A(ρ) to be positive. The relations (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ) at
the CO radius then further eliminate the scenario of A+

      <title>NULL COs AND THEIR STABILITIES</title>
      <p>
        For null geodesics, the existence conditions (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ) for the
null COs becomes
with c1 &gt; 0 and A− since they do not allow any CO.
Combining these, then the condition (a) is equivalent to
the statement that:
(Theorem C) For an SAS spacetime with metric function
A(ρ) = ρ c1ρ + pc21ρ2 − 2c2
where c1 and c2 are
negative but otherwise arbitrary constants, there will exist
timelike COs and these COs are always MSCOs.
      </p>
      <p>Condition (b) allows better generality than (a) due to
the arbitrariness of σ(ρ) but has proven to be difficult to
solve. This difficulty on one hand is due to the
nonlinearity of the equation, and on the other due to the
nonhomogeneity of σ(ρ). Therefore we tried to replace σ(ρ)
by a homogenous term, such as χ(ρ)ρ2A′3, χ(ρ)ρAA′2 or
χ(ρ)A2A′, where χ(ρ) is also an arbitrary function that
has the same sign as σ(ρ). This way since the other
factors in these terms are all positive, if the resulting
equations were solvable, we can still obtain some sufficient
conditions with enough generality on the stability of the
COs. Again it is very unfortunate that these equations
do not allow explicit solutions when χ(ρ) is an arbitrary
function. At last, we further set χ(ρ) to be constants
χ, and the resultant equations became simple enough to
solve and each solved A(ρ) is a sufficient conditions for
the CO to be stable or unstable, depending on the sign of
χ. The detailed forms of these A(ρ)’s are quite implicit
and not directly useful, and therefore we only list them
in Appendix A.</p>
      <p>Similar to the situation in section IV, one can also
tackle the stability problem of timelike COs at large ρ
with the help of asymptotic flatness and positive ADM
mass. From Theorem B, we see the existence of timelike
COs at large ρ for metrics having asymptotics (32) with
c &lt; 0 and β = 1. For these COs, substituting A(ρ) into
Eq. (36), we find
h(ρ) =
a2cβ(β − 2)
ρβ+1
+ O(ρ−(β+2)),
(40)
which is positive to the leading order. This means we
can have the following result:
(Theorem D) The equatorial timelike COs at large ρ
in the asymptotically flat SAS spacetime with positive
ADM mass are always stable.</p>
      <p>
        To conclude this section, let us mention that an
especially simple sufficient condition for the COs to be stable
can be obtained from (38) just by observation. Noticing
that h(ρ) can be recast into
h(ρ∗) = A′ (A − ρ∗A′) (3A − ρ∗A′) + ρ∗A2A′′
(41)
and that the three factors in the first term of the right
hand side are all positive, we see that as long as the
last term is semi-positive definite, then the COs will be
unstable. That is, the COs will be stable if A′′ ≥ 0 for
all ρ.

(46)
(47)
where ψ1(ρ) is a positive and monotonically increasing
but otherwise arbitrary function, and
where ψ2(ρ) is an positive and monotonically
decreasing but otherwise arbitrary function. In other words, we
have:
(Theorem E) The equatorial null COs for the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        )
do not exist if and only if its metric function A(ρ) takes
the form of either Eq. (46) or Eq. (47) in the entire range
of ρ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing with the TCONET, any metric function
A(ρ) satisfying Eqs. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) will satisfy Eq. (44) or
equivalently Eq. (46). However metric satisfying (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ) will not
satisfy either of Eqs. (44) and (45) when the equality
δ(ρ) = 0 or κ′(ρ) = 0 is taken. This means that there
are SAS spacetimes that does not have timelike COs but
still allow null COs. An example can be constructed as
κ(ρ) = a3 + (ρ − a)3
A(ρ) = ρκ(ρ) = ρ a3 + (ρ − a)3 ,
(a &gt; 0),
(48)
which leads to κ′(r) = 3(ρ − a)2 ≥ 0 and therefore A(ρ)
respects Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and has no timelike CO. It is also clear
that at ρ = a, A − ρA′ = 0 and therefore there exist a
null CO. On the other hand, one can also give examples
of metrics that allow timelike COs but not null CO, such
It is clear that Eq. (42) will always be satisfied by some
ρ, E and L. Eq. (43) will have no solution and therefore
no COs if and only if for all ρ &gt; 0, we have either

or</p>
      <p>A(ρ) − ρA′(ρ) = −η2(ρ) &lt; 0,
where η1(ρ) and η2(ρ) are two positive arbitrary
functions. Noticing that A(ρ) and A′(ρ) are both continuous,
it is seen that the Eqs. (44) and (45) cannot be satisfied
piecewisely in the range of ρ without letting A(ρ)−ρA′(ρ)
pass zero, i.e., having a CO.</p>
      <p>
        Eqs. (44) and (45) have the same form as Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        )
and the solutions are respectively

      <p>L = ± ρ∗

        1 2M
ρ + 2M , A(ρ) = ρψ2(ρ) = 1 − ρ + 2M
(49)
where M &gt; 0 is the ADM mass. The ψ2(ρ) here is
positive and has a negative derivative and therefore will have
no null CO. It is also easy to verify that A(ρ) violates
both conditions (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ) and (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ) and therefore allows
timelike COs.
      </p>
      <p>We can impose the asymptotic flatness condition to the
metric. Similar to the timelike case however, this
condition alone will not guarantee the existence of null COs. If
we further require that the asymptotically flat spacetime
should have a positive ADM mass, then clearly the
corresponding metric will break the non-existence condition
(46), but not necessarily the condition (47). Indeed, the
metric (49) is such an example: this metric is
asymptotically flat and still satisfies Eq. (47) and therefore has
no null CO. Because for asymptotic flat SAS spacetimes
with a positive ADM mass, Theorem B guarantees the
existence of timelike COs, the above example shows that
for these spacetimes the existence of null COs has more
stringent requirement.</p>

        In spite of our incapability of producing a general
existence theorem for null COs, from physical
considerations such as asymptotic flatness and positive ADM mass,
we can still prove the following theorem that we believe
might be useful for special spacetimes:
(Theorem F) If there exist a finite range of ρ ∈ [a, b)
where 0 &lt; a &lt; b such that the metric function A(ρ =
a) = 0 and A(a &lt; ρ &lt; b) &gt; 0, and A(ρ → ∞) does not
diverge faster than ρ1, then this metric allows null COs.
The proof of this is simple and given in Appendix B.
Since known BH spacetimes described by the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        )
usually has a radius ρBH at which A(ρBH) = 0, this
theorem might be especially useful to judge the existence of
null COs around such BHs.
      </p>
      <p>We can also consider the stability of null COs using
the Lyapunov exponent. In this case, the Lyapunov
exponents are
We see that the only factor whose sign is not fixed and
cannot be fixed by Eqs. (42) and (43), is A′′(ρ∗). When
A′′(ρ∗) is positive, zero or negative, the null CO will be
stable, marginally stable or unstable respectively. Similar
to the study of stability of timelike COs in section V, we
can equate A′′ to some positive (or negative, or zero)
definite arbitrary functions and solve for some general
forms of A(ρ) whose null COs will definitely be stable
(or unstable, or have marginal stability). However, these
general forms are too trivial to be used to judge stabilities
of COs in known SAS spacetimes and therefore they are
not shown here.</p>
      <p>
        In our previous work [20], the existence and stability
of COs in static and spherically symmetric (SSS)
spacetimes were studied and various theorems were obtained.
Since SSS spacetime is also SAS, we first verify that the
theorems obtained in the current work should also apply
to the SSS case and therefore reproduce the theorems in
Ref. [20] when the metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ) is reduced to the metric
used in Ref. [20]:
where (tS, r, θ, φS) are the coordinates. It is only
necessary to consider the geodesics in the equatorial plane,
defined by θ = π/2 and therefore the SSS metric in this
plane becomes
1
ds2 = f (r)dt2S − g(r) dr2 − r2dφ2S.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then apparent the coordinate change transforming
metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ) to metric (52) can be chosen as
      </p>
      <p>tS = t, φS = φ, r2 =
and the metric functions should match as
f (r(ρ)) = A(ρ), g(r(ρ)) =</p>
      <p>ρ2
A(ρ)</p>
      <p>
        ,
1 dρ2
D(ρ) dr2
(52)
(53)
(54)
(55)
Under this transformation, the factor Φ(ρ) in the
potential (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ), which becomes the starting point of the analysis
in Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ), can be transformed to
Φ(ρ) → Φ(r) =
      </p>
      <p>1
4r2f (r)2</p>
      <p>E2 L2
f 2 − r2 − ǫ .</p>
      <p>Except an irrelevant factor, this is exact the potential
V (r) in Ref. [20]. Since all theorems in that work are
then derived from this potential, they will be in
agreement with the theorems obtained in current work. This
checks that the analysis and results for the equatorial
motions in the SAS spacetime implies the results obtained
in Ref. [20] for the SSS spacetime, as it should.</p>
      <p>
        The original motivation of the work is to find COs
for spacetimes whose metric functions are not
analytically known. Usually in classical gravity models once
the ansatz for the metric (and matter) functions are
chosen, their Einstein(-matter) equations are easy to
derive. Due to the non-linearity of these equations,
analytical solutions are usually unavailable except in a few
notable cases, and then numerical methods to different
levels of complexity and difficulties, are used with the
help of boundary conditions. In analyzing the COs in
such metrics, we realized that the existence and stability
of the COs can be determined without having to know
the numerical solution. We now show as an example that
the results in this work can be applied to metric in the
EYMD model studied in Ref. [7]. In this work the SAS
ansatz for the metric in the equatorial plane is given by
m(r) r2l(r)
ds2 = f (r)dt2EYMD − f (r) dr2 − f (r) dφ2EYMD, (56)
where (tEYMD, r, θEYMD, φEYMD) are the coordinates
and θEYMD = π/2 was set. It is not hard to verify that
this metric is equivalent to metric (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ) if the following
coordinate transforms are used
      </p>
      <p>t = tEYMD, φ = φEYMD, ρ2 = r2l(r)
and metric functions are identified</p>
      <p>A(ρ(r)) = f (r),
D(ρ)2 =
m(r) dr2
f (r) dρ2
.</p>
      <p>It is also known from Eq. (C10) of Ref. [7] that the
asymptotic expansion of the metric functions f (r) and
l(r) are respectively
f (r) = 1 − crf + 2crf22 + O(r−3),</p>
      <p>c
l(r) = 1 − r2l + O(r−3),
with cf &gt; 0 and cl &gt; 0 being constants. The relations
(57), (58), (60) and (61) imply that the asymptotic of
A(ρ) is</p>
      <p>A(ρ) = 1 − cρf + 2cρf22 + O(ρ−3).</p>
      <p>This means that the metric function is asymptotically
flat with a positive ADM mass. Therefore according to
Theorem B and D, this spacetime will always allow
timelike COs in its equatorial plane and the timelike COs at
large ρ are stable. This example shows the power of the
results in this work.</p>
      <p>Similar to our previous work [20], we can also use the
theorems obtained in this paper to study the existences
and stabilities of the COs of some general SAS metrics.
A total of four metrics from Ref. [31] are examined in
Table I. Their A(ρ) components set at the equatorial plane
are given in the first column, and their allowance of the
timelike and null COs are listed in the second and third
columns respectively. In column four we list for the
metrics allowing COs whether they are asymptotically flat
and if yes the sign of the ADM mass. It is clear that an
asymptotic flat spacetime with a positive ADM mass
always permits the existence of timelike COs, as we stated
in Theorem B, section IV.</p>
      <p>
        For the extension of the current work, two possible
directions are of special interests. The first is to extend
the analysis for SAS spacetimes to stationary and
ax(57)
(58)
(59)
(60)
(61)
(62)
isymmetric spacetimes because many axisymmetric and
physically important spacetimes are stationary but not
static. An analysis for the COs in stationary spacetimes
therefore will be more useful in the perspective of
applications. In the stationary case, since B(ρ) in (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ) will
be nonzero, the equations analogous to Eq. (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ) will
contains two arbitrary functions A(ρ) and B(ρ) rather
than one A(ρ) and a cross-terms proportional to EL will
appear. Even though these make the analysis more
complicated, some preliminary work shows that the
(non)existence condition might be still solvable.
      </p>
      <p>Another direction of extension is to consider the
stability issues of non-radical perturbations in general
stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes due to its relevance to
the dynamics of a finitely thick disk in the accretion phase
of the (binary) rotating systems. The zenithal
stability issue in particular axisymmetric spacetimes has been
studied recently in Ref. [29] and an analysis using
Lyapunov exponent method for general metrics might reveal
more general stability conditions on metric functions.</p>

Although the sign of A′′ and consequently that of the

only have stable COs (if any) and no MSCOs. When
χ = −1/2, or χ = −5/2, Eq. (A12) can also generate
some explicit solutions of A(ρ). However, since sign of
their second derivatives cannot be determined, and we
will not list them here.</p>

    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>Appendix B: Proof of Theorem F</title>
      <p>To prove the theorem, we define a µ (ρ) first
such that</p>
      <p>µ (ρ) = A(ρ)/ρ
µ ′(ρ) = [A′(ρ)ρ − A(ρ)] /ρ2.
(B1)
(B2)
Then using Eq. (43) it is seen that the existence of a null
CO is equivalent to the existence of a point such that
µ ′(ρ) = 0.</p>
      <p>Now since A(ρ = a) = 0, we have</p>
      <p>µ ′(ρ = a) = A′(ρ = a)/a2.</p>
      <p>Since A(ρ) &gt; 0 for at least the neighborhood (a, b) of ρ,
we must have A′(ρ = a) ≥ 0. Therefore
µ ′(ρ = a) ≥ 0.
(B4)
If the equal sign is true, then the CO exists. If it is not
true, we further show by contradiction that µ ′(ρ) cannot
be positive definite for ρ ∈ [a, ∞) and therefore due to
the continuity of µ ′(ρ) there must exist a point ρ∗
satisfying µ ′(ρ∗) = 0, which is again a CO. Suppose µ ′(ρ) &gt; 0
for all ρ ∈ [a, ∞), then clearly A(ρ) = µ (ρ)ρ will diverge
faster than ρ1, which contradicts the assumption.
