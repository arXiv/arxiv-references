                    "p":"Microscopy is the workhorse of the physical and life sciences, producing crisp images of everything from atoms to cells well beyond the capabilities of the human eye. However, the analysis of these images is frequently little better than automated manual marking. Here, we revolutionize the analysis of microscopy images, extracting all the information theoretically contained in a complex microscope image. Using a generic, methodological approach, we extract the information by tting experimental images with a detailed optical model of the microscope, a method we call Parameter Extraction from Reconstructing Images (PERI). As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this approach with a confocal image of colloidal spheres, improving measurements of particle positions and radii by 100x over current methods and attaining the maximum possible accuracy. With this unprecedented resolution, we measure nanometer-scale colloidal interactions in dense suspensions solely with light microscopy, a previously impossible feat. Our approach is generic and applicable to imaging methods from bright eld to electron microscopy, where we expect accuracies of 1 nm and 0:1 pm, respectively."

This gives\na representation of the correctly-aliased Platonic image (x; a) of a sphere of radius a as\n(x) = S(x)\nh 2\n2 2 2\nx y z\n1=2 e x2=2 x2 e y2=2 y2 e z2=2 z2 i\nwhere r is the distance from the particle's center. The rst bracketed group of terms corresponds to treating the\nsphere as a at surface, and the second bracketed group corresponds to the e ects the sphere's curvature on the\nintegral. In each sub-grouping, the rst term that depends on r a re ects the contribution due to the particle's\nnearer edge, and the second term that depends on r + a re ects the contribution due to the particle's farther edge.\nWe then t in Eq. S4 to best match the exact Fourier space image of a sphere, giving a value 0:276.",
                                "Although Eq. S3 does not admit a simple solution for zscale 6= 1, we can use the exact form for zscale = 1 to construct\nan approximate solution. Since both erf(x) and e x2 approach their asymptotic values extremely rapidly, and since\nat the best t 0:276 (a + r)= 1 for even moderately small radii, the terms erf((a + r)= p2) 0:5 and\nexp( (r + a)2=2 2) 0 to an excellent accuracy. We then write the position vector in terms of its direction x^ and a\nvector x as x ax^ + x, and replace (a r)= in Equation (S4) by p( x= x)2 + ( y= y)2 + ( z= z)2. Note that\nthis approximation is exact in the limit of in nite sphere radii. Empirically, we nd that this approximation works\nquite well, giving di erences in the Platonic image of a few percent from a numerical solution to Eq. S3 as well as\nhigh resolution boolean cut real-space spheres (see Fig. S1).",
                                "While this implementation of the Platonic image correctly captures most of the e ects of nite-pixel size, there are\nstill some minor details that need to be xed to give unbiased images. By construction, Eq. (S4) conserves volume\n{ its integral over all space is 4=3 a3 since the Gaussian kernel is normalized. However, when (x) is sampled on a\npixelated grid, its sum is not exactly 4=3 a3 but is slightly di erent, depending on the position of the particle's center\nrelative to a voxel's center. The slight change in volume is important for two reasons. First, the convolution with the\nPSF in our image generation (see next subsection) suppresses high-frequency portions of the image, but it does not\na ect the q = 0 component, i.e. the image sum or the particle volume. Since we aim to create a Platonic image that\naccurately represents the nal image, we need the q = 0 component of the Platonic image to be correct. Secondly,\nas discussed in section IV the real microscope image is actually an integral over a nite pixel area. As such, the\nimage recorded on the detector preserves the particle's volume or the q = 0 component of the image. To circumvent\nthis issue of incorrect particle volume, instead of drawing the particle at its actual radius we draw it with a slightly\ndi erent radius that preserves the particle's volume, which we accomplish with an iterative scheme. The results of this\niterative scheme are shown in Fig. S1 along with the errors it introduces. Incidentally, the e ects of image pixelation\non image moments higher than h1i, e.g. hxi and its e ects on the particle positions, are much smaller than the noise\noor in our data at a moderate SNR (see section IV).",
                                "The representation in equation S4 is the best method for forming Platonic spheres on a pixelated grid that we have\nfound. However, there are other, simpler methods which work almost as well as the Platonic sphere. Aside from the\nimportant curvature term, equation S4 is basically an erf() interpolation between particle and void at the particle's\nedge. Other interpolation schemes can provide similar results. For instance, the spheres could be constructed by\nignoring the curvature term and replacing the erf with a logistic 1=(1 + exp((r a)= )), a linear interpolation between\nparticle and void at the pixel edge, or a cubic interpolation at the pixel edge. We have also implemented these methods\nfor generating Platonic images of spheres, tting the parameters to match the exact Fourier representation. For the\nlogistic we t , for the linear interpolation we t the slope, and for the cubic we t one parameter and constrain the\nother two such that the Platonic image and its derivative are continuous. While all of these methods are functional,\nthey are not signi cantly faster than the exact Gaussian approximation in equation S4 and result in slightly worse\nfeaturing errors (see table I). As a result, we use the exact Gaussian approximation, but include these other options in\nour package for ease of use with more complicated shapes where the integral in equation S3 might not be analytically\ntractable.",
                                "The Platonic image needs to represent accurately all objects in the image, not just the spheres. In particular, when\nthe solvent is dyed, the image usually contains a dark coverslip or its shadow from the point-spread function. We\nmodel this dark coverslip as a slab occupying a half-space. The slab is characterized by a z-position and by a unit\nnormal n^ denoting the perpendicular to the plane. To capture accurately sub-pixel displacements of the slab, we\nuse the image of a slab convolved with a Gaussian as above for a sphere; for the slab this gives a simple error (erf)\nfunction."

                        "Once an approximate initial guess is obtained by more traditional featuring methods [S44], we optimize the\nparameters by tting using a modi ed Levenberg-Marquardt routine. Our Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm uses\npreviouslyreported optimization strategies designed for large parameter spaces [S32]. However, a Levenberg-Marquardt\nminimization requires the matrix Ji @m(xi)=@ , which is the gradient of each pixel in the model with respect to all\nthe parameters. For the 105 parameters and 107 pixels in our image, this matrix would be many thousand times\ntoo large to store in memory. Instead, we construct a random approximation to Ji by using a random sub-section\nof pixels xi in the image to compute J . This approach works well for the global parameters (PSF, ILM, etc) but\nfails for the particles, which appear in a relatively small number of pixels. For the particles, we instead t small\ngroups of adjacent particles using the full Ji for the local region of a ected pixels. As the global parameters and\nparticle parameters are coupled, we iterate by optimizing rst the globals, then the particles, and repeating until the\noptimization has converged.",
                        "Once the model is optimized, we can employ two di erent methods to extract the errors associated with each\nparameter. Since we calculated the gradients J during the optimization procedure, we can use this to nd the\ncovariance matrix (J T J ) 1 which gives the correlated sensitivities of each parameter. In practice this is the faster\nmethod and yields accurate results and, as such, is our method of choice. However, additionally, we may use Monte\nCarlo sampling to estimate parameter errors. Our Monte Carlo sampler sweeps over each parameter and updates\nthe particle position, accepting or rejecting based on the change in the log-likelihood of the model. We use slice\nsampling to produce highly uncorrelated samples, allowing an excellent error estimate from only a few sweeps. Our\nerror sampling doubles as a check for convergence. If the log-likelihood increases after sampling, then the optimization\nhas not converged and either more Monte Carlo sampling or more traditional optimization is needed. In practice,\nwhen desired we check with 5 10 Monte Carlo sweeps, and ensure that the log-likelihood remains the same or\nuctuates by a few times pN , where N is the number of parameters in the model."

For\nmaximal realism, we generate these images with every model component in equation S2 as realistic as possible. We use\nour exact calculation for line-scanning confocal microscopes, with physical parameters expected from an experiment.\nFrom the structure of our tted line-scan confocal images, we re-create a random illumination eld that closely mimics\nthe power spectrum of our actual confocal. We position the particles randomly, without placing them preferentially\non the center or edge of a pixel. Since real images have particles that are also outside or partially inside the image,\nwe generate the image on a large region before cropping to an internal region, resulting in edge particles and particles\noutside the eld of view. 3",
                        "We then t these algorithms both with PERI and with traditional centroid-based featuring algorithms. When we\nt these images with PERI we start with initial guesses that are not near the correct parameter values, to ensure\nthat our method is robust to realistic initial guesses. For the centroid featuring methods, there are several algorithms\nand variants that can be used. We use the most commonly used of these versions, as implemented by Crocker and\nGrier [S44] in the IDL language. All of these centroid algorithms require the user to select various parameters, such\nas a lter size for smoothing of the noisy image and a mask size for nding the centroid positions. As is well-known\nin the colloid community, using the incorrect parameters can result in signi cantly poorer results. To overcome any\npossible limitation from using the incorrect parameters, we t all the possible parameters4 in the Crocker-Grier (CG)\nalgorithm and use only the ones that produces the best global featuring of the data, as compared to the correct\nparticle positions. (Centroid methods do not accurately nd particle radii). Needless to say, an actual experimenter\ndoes not have access to the ground truth or to the optimal parameters for the featuring.

As\nsuch, we view the centroid featuring errors as unrealistically optimistic and probably not attainable with centroid\nmethods even by experts. The results of these comparisons are shown in Fig. S15.",
                        "When two particles are close, their images overlap due to the breadth of the point-spread function. This overlap\ncauses centroid methods considerable di culty. To compare the e ects of PSF overlap on both PERI and CG featured\npositions, we generate an ensemble of realistic images with isolated pairs of particles at random orientations and at\na xed particle edge-to-edge separations. The upper-left panel shows these results for edge-to-edge separations from\n0:01 px to 2:0 px, with a xed noise scale of about 0:05 of the illumination amount. As the randomly-generated\nillumination elds vary from image to image, and the illumination varies from region to region within an image, there\nis not truly a global SNR for all of the images; the uctuations in this SNR from image to image are the origins of\nthe uctuations in featuring error throughout Fig. S15. PERI features particles at the Cramer-Rao bound regardless\nof their separation. In contrast, even at large separations of 2 px, CG has signi cant errors due to particle overlaps.",

                        "Since the CRB decreases with particle radius, we expect that increasing the particle radius should result in an\nincrease in localization accuracy. The lower-left panel of Fig. S15 shows that PERI's precision improves with increasing\nparticle radius. In contrast, the Crocker-Grier precision worsens with increasing particle radius. We hypothesize this\narises due to the at intensity pro le near the center of a large particle, whereas a centroid method assumes that the\nintensity is peaked at the particle center. As a result, slight noise can signi cantly worsen a large particle's localization\nwith centroid methods. Conversely, centroid algorithms improve for small particles, performing only 3 worse than\nPERI's localization accuracy for particles with radius 2 px. For particles small to the PSF size, the image is essentially\na single peak, which centroid methods work well for.",
                        "Realistic images taken with confocal microscopes consist of particles randomly distributed, occasionally close\ntogether and occasionally far apart. To examine the localization in these images, we use a Brownian dynamics simulation\nto create a random distribution of particles at volume fractions from = 0:1 to = 0:6. PERI localizes particle\npositions and radii excellently in all of these images, as visible in the lower-right panel. In contrast, centroid methods\nperform uniformly poorly, with localization accuracies of approximately half a pixel. Interestingly, these centroid\nalgorithms do not localize signi cantly worse for dense suspensions despite the presence of more close particles, although\nthey do frequently fail to identify particles.",
                        "Finally, we check how the complexity of our synthetic data a ects the accuracy of standard featuring methods. In\nTable II we see, surprisingly, that there is a non-monotonic relationship between positional error and image complexity,\nbecoming optimal when there is signi cant striping in the image but little variation in depth. However, the rate of\nmissing particles decreases signi cantly with simpler models and rising to as much as 40% for our most complex model\nimages. The e ective resolution of CG is never much smaller than a single pixel in these synthetic tests, most likely\ndue to pixel edge biases."

Since we know the particles' positions and radii via PERI, we seed the simulation with the\nfeatured particle positions and radii and relax the particle positions thoroughly before sampling for Ps( ). Using the\nextracted particle parameters enforces both the correct amount of particle radii polydispersity and the number density\nof particles. In the simulation we use a standard DLVO potential, consisting of non-retarded van der Waals attractions\nand Debye-Huckel repulsion [S45], augmented by gravitational settling. The free parameters we t are the strength of\nthe attraction, the strength and screening length of the repulsion, and the gravitational settling strength; physically\nthese correspond to the Hamaker constant, a combination of the particle zeta potential and salt concentration, and\nthe average particle density.",
                        "Since the Ps( ) is measured from the simulation as a histogram with a nite number of samples, each simulated\nPs( ) is somewhat noisy. In light of this noise, we use a Nelder-Mead algorithm to nd a good initial estimate of\nthe t parameters. We then re ne this estimate of the t parameters. First, we t the ensemble of simulations to\nan approximate model which is locally linear in the t parameters. We then use this linear model to estimate a new\nset of best- t interaction parameters and re ne our estimate of the potential; the curve plotted in Fig. 3 of the main\ntext is the Ps( ) generated from the linear model at the best t parameters. To estimate uncertainties in the t, we\nrepeat this process by tting a random subset of half of the simulations to a model and nding the new set of best- t\ninteractions. Repeating this 1000 times provides an estimate on the best- t parameters as the mean of these best- t\nparameters, and the uncertainty as the standard deviation of those parameters. Finally, we also obtain an estimate\nof systematic errors due to mis-featuring of particle positions and radii by xing each particle's radius to be its mean\nvalue throughout all the images it is measured in. Surprisingly, xing each particle's radius to a value that does not\nuctuate in time worsens both the reconstrunction and the experimentally-measured Ps( ), producing about three\ntimes as many overlaps. This probably arises because in some sense PERI directly measures the particle separations\nfrom the microscope image { changing the separation of two particles slightly will considerably change the fraction\nof uorescing dye separating them. Nevertheless, this xed-radius data gives an order-of-magnitude estimate of any\nsystematics in the experimentally-measured Ps( ).
